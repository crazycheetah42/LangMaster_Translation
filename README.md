# LangMaster_Translation
This is LangMaster, a translation app for Windows. I made it in Python.

LangMaster supports all Google Translate languages. Upcoming features are:
1. Screenshot readability

   This feature will allow you to upload an image and it will automatically get the text and translate it.
2. Resizability

   This feature will allow you to make the window smaller. As of now, you can make the window bigger than the default size with it properly resizing, but making the window smaller removes some of the buttons and drop-downs, so making the window smaller with proper resizing is a feature I will be working on.
3. More OSes!

   Most people (including me) use Windows, so I made a Windows executable for it. I will try my best to make Mac and Linux executables so everyone can enjoy this app.
