# LangMaster_Translation
This is LangMaster, a translation app for Windows. I made it in Python.

LangMaster supports all Google Translate languages. Upcoming features are:
1. Screenshot readability

   This feature will allow you to upload an image and it will automatically get the text and translate it.
3. More OSes!

   Most people (including me) use Windows, so I made a Windows executable for it. I will try my best to make Mac and Linux executables so everyone can enjoy this app.
